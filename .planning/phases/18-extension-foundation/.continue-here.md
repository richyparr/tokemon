<current_state>
Between milestones. Completed v4.0 planning (roadmap/requirements) but then detoured to:
1. Make Tokemon completely free and open source (MIT license)
2. Set up comprehensive automated testing infrastructure

Now ready to start Phase 18 (Extension Foundation) for the Raycast extension.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**This Session:**
- Made Tokemon free and open source with MIT license
  - Removed LemonSqueezy licensing integration
  - Removed FeatureAccessManager and all Pro-gating
  - Deleted 7 licensing files (LicenseManager, LicenseStorage, LicenseState, etc.)
  - All features now free for all users
  - Added MIT LICENSE file to repository

- Set up comprehensive automated testing infrastructure
  - Created 8 unit test files (TokemonTests/)
  - Enhanced UI tests for layout/overflow/accessibility (TokemonLayoutTests, TokemonAccessibilityTests)
  - Created automation scripts (test.sh, build.sh, lint.sh)
  - Added GitHub Actions CI pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  - Added SwiftLint configuration (.swiftlint.yml)

**Prior v4.0 Setup:**
- Completed v4.0 Raycast extension research
- Defined 15 requirements across 5 categories
- Created 4-phase roadmap (Phases 18-21)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 18: Extension Foundation**
- Plan not yet created
- Need to run `/gsd:plan-phase 18`
- Will create basic Raycast extension with usage display

**Full v4.0 Roadmap:**
- Phase 18: Extension Foundation (basic usage display)
- Phase 19: Polish & Preferences (quick actions, shortcuts)
- Phase 20: Advanced Features (alerts, charts)
- Phase 21: Store Preparation (docs, screenshots, submission)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Made Tokemon MIT licensed to match competitor (Usage) for Raycast Store credibility
- Removed all licensing/Pro code rather than just disabling (cleaner codebase)
- Set up testing infrastructure now to ensure stability before v4.0 work
- Unit tests target core business logic (analytics, burn rate, models)
- UI tests focus on layout/overflow/accessibility issues
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Ready to proceed with Phase 18 planning.
</blockers>

<context>
Just finished setting up testing and making the app free. The macOS app (v1-v3) is stable and complete.
v4.0 is a completely new TypeScript/React codebase in `raycast-extension/` directory (to be created).
The Raycast extension will be standalone - no dependency on Tokemon.app.
Key technical constraint: Raycast Store blocks Keychain access, so users must enter tokens manually.
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 18` to create the Extension Foundation plan.
This will scaffold the Raycast extension project and implement basic usage display.
</next_action>
