Phase 9 execution in progress. Plan 09-01 complete. Plan 09-02 at checkpoint - waiting for user to verify the "Share Usage Card" button works.

During checkpoint verification, user identified popover height issues and UI redundancy. Fixed:
1. Removed duplicate "5-hour usage" and "Resets in" rows (now consolidated in header)
2. Header subtitle now shows reset timer directly
3. Finalized popover heights: 385px without chart, 620px with chart
</current_state>

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Plan 09-02 Task 2: Get user approval for "Share Usage Card" button
  - User needs to test: click button in Analytics, paste image, verify branding
- After approval: Create 09-02-SUMMARY.md
- After approval: Run phase verification
- After approval: Update ROADMAP.md with phase completion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Removed duplicate "5-hour usage" row - big % already shows this
- Moved "Resets in" to header subtitle for prominence
- Popover heights: 385px (no chart), 620px (with chart)
- Heights account for Extra Usage section + trial banner
</decisions_made>

None - just waiting for user to return and approve the checkpoint.

Phase 9 is the final phase of v2.0. Once the Share Usage Card button is approved, the phase completes and we can run /gsd:complete-milestone to archive v2.0.

The Share Usage Card feature:
- Creates a 320x200pt card (640x400px at 2x)
- Shows weekly avg utilization, top project, tokens
- ClaudeMon branding + claudemon.app footer for viral marketing
- Pro-gated via .usageCards feature
- One-click copy to clipboard
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming:
1. Ask user to test the Share Usage Card button if not already done
2. Get "approved" response for checkpoint
3. Spawn continuation agent to complete 09-02 (create SUMMARY.md)
4. Run phase verification
5. Proceed to /gsd:complete-milestone for v2.0
</next_action>
