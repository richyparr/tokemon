- Execute Phase 8 (3 plans, 6 tasks total)
- Plan and execute Phase 9 (Shareable Moments)

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- No new dependencies needed (all native Apple frameworks)
- Analytics UI in Settings tab (not popover - too dense)
- Project breakdown is cross-account ("This Machine" view)
- HistoryStore downsampling: 7d full resolution, older data hourly averaged
- PDF uses solid colors only (ImageRenderer macOS gradient bug)
- NSSavePanel standalone (not beginSheetModal) for LSUIElement app

</decisions_made>
