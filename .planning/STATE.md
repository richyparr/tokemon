## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: OAuth endpoint is primary data source, JSONL is fallback (not the other way around per research correction)
- [Roadmap]: WidgetKit widget deferred to v2 (refresh budget too limiting for real-time monitoring)
- [Roadmap]: Non-sandboxed distribution via GitHub (required for ~/.claude access)
- [Roadmap]: Design polish phase last (per user preference, after all features built)
- [01-01]: SPM executable target instead of .xcodeproj (Xcode not installed; swift build works)
- [01-01]: StatusItemManager callback pattern to solve menu bar label not updating
- [01-01]: DataSourceState.failed uses String (not Error) for Sendable conformance

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- JSONL format is undocumented and has changed between Claude Code versions; defensive parsing required from Phase 1
- Admin API requires org admin keys; most individual Pro/Max users cannot obtain these (DATA-05 is optional enhancement)
