<decisions_made>

- LemonSqueezy pricing model: Standard (simple subscription)
- Free trial: OFF in LemonSqueezy (handled in-app via LicenseManager's 14-day trial)
- License activation limit: 5 (allows multiple Macs per user)
- Popover height: Increased to accommodate trial banner + footer icons

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- Popover height: User reported content still cut off at top/bottom with 520px height. May need further adjustment or dynamic sizing.

</blockers>

<context>
User is setting up real licensing before continuing with Phase 8. The goal is to run ClaudeMon as a licensed Pro user while developing the remaining features. LemonSqueezy is fully configured, just need to resolve the UI clipping issue and verify the activation flow works end-to-end.

Build command: `swift build` then `.build/debug/ClaudeMon`
</context>

<next_action>
1. Have user test the 520px popover height
2. If still clipped, investigate dynamic height or increase further
3. Once UI is good, test license activation with real key
4. Then run `/gsd:plan-phase 8` to continue with Analytics & Export
</next_action>
