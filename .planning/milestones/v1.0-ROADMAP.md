# Milestone v1.0: ClaudeMon MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-14
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 12

## Overview

ClaudeMon delivers a native macOS menu bar utility for monitoring Claude usage at a glance. The app shows live usage data from Claude Code OAuth endpoint with JSONL fallback, configurable alerts, usage trend visualization, an always-on-top floating window, and three customizable themes.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Monitoring

**Goal**: User can see their current Claude usage at a glance from the menu bar, with live data from OAuth endpoint and Claude Code logs
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Xcode project foundation, menu bar app shell with popover, data models, and mock polling
- [x] 01-02: Real data layer: OAuth client, Keychain token manager, JSONL parser, live data in UsageMonitor
- [x] 01-03: Popover UI polish, settings window, right-click context menu, error states, human verification

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Menu bar status item with usage percentage/token count display
- OAuth endpoint integration with automatic token refresh
- JSONL parsing from ~/.claude/projects for fallback data
- Three-tab settings window (General, Data Sources, Appearance)
- Gear dropdown menu with Settings and Quit options

### Phase 2: Alerts & Notifications

**Goal**: User receives timely warnings when approaching Claude usage limits, with configurable thresholds and delivery preferences
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: AlertManager service with threshold checking, visual warning indicators in menu bar and popover
- [x] 02-02: macOS system notifications, Alerts settings tab with threshold config, notification toggle, launch at login

**Key Accomplishments:**
- AlertManager with warning (80%) and critical (100%) thresholds
- Color-coded visual indicators in menu bar and popover
- macOS system notifications with sound
- Launch at login via SMAppService

### Phase 3: Usage Trends & API Integration

**Goal**: User can understand their usage patterns over time and project when they will hit limits, with optional API-based cost tracking for org admins
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Historical data storage with HistoryStore actor, UsageDataPoint model, JSON persistence
- [x] 03-02: Swift Charts visualization, BurnRateCalculator for pace/projection, UsageChartView and BurnRateView
- [x] 03-03: Optional Admin API integration with AdminAPIClient, Keychain storage, AdminAPISettings tab

**Key Accomplishments:**
- HistoryStore actor with 30-day retention and JSON persistence
- Swift Charts area+line visualization with 24h/7d toggle
- BurnRateCalculator with 2-hour rolling window
- Time-to-limit projection with urgency coloring
- Optional Admin API key storage for org admins

### Phase 4: Floating Window

**Goal**: User can keep a compact, always-visible usage display on screen while working
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: FloatingPanel NSPanel subclass, FloatingWindowController service, NSWindow position extension
- [x] 04-02: FloatingWindowView UI with live data, context menu integration, human verification

**Key Accomplishments:**
- NSPanel with .nonactivatingPanel for non-focus-stealing behavior
- Automatic position persistence via setFrameAutosaveName
- Compact usage display with live data via @Environment
- Toggle from gear menu and keyboard shortcut (Cmd+F)

### Phase 5: Theming & Design Polish

**Goal**: App looks polished and professional with three distinct theme options applied consistently across all display modes
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Theme infrastructure (AppTheme enum, ThemeColors, ThemeManager) and theme picker in AppearanceSettings
- [x] 05-02: Wire themes to PopoverContentView, FloatingWindowView, UsageChartView, visual verification

**Key Accomplishments:**
- Three themes: Native macOS, Minimal Dark, Anthropic-inspired
- ThemeColors struct for semantic color resolution
- Themes apply to popover, floating window, and charts
- Minimal Dark forces dark mode, others follow system

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- OAuth endpoint as primary data source, JSONL as fallback
- SPM executable target (Xcode not required)
- Custom SettingsWindowController for LSUIElement app
- Actor isolation for HistoryStore (Swift concurrency native)
- ThemeColors for semantic color resolution

**Technical Debt:**
- OAuth credentials not available during development (tested with JSONL fallback only)
- Admin API requires org admin keys (most individual users cannot obtain these)
