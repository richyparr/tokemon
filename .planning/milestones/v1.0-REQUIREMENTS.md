## Traceability Summary

| Phase | Requirements Covered | Count |
|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Phase 1 | DATA-01-04,06, MENU-01-06, USAGE-01-05, SET-01,03,05 | 17 |

## Out of Scope (v1)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Mac App Store distribution | Sandbox blocks ~/.claude access; distribute via GitHub |
| Real-time Notification Center widget | WidgetKit limited to 40-70 refreshes/day |
| Multi-provider monitoring | Focus on Claude-only for best-in-class experience |
| Claude.ai scraping | Too fragile; using OAuth endpoint instead |
| Automatic model switching | v2+ analytics feature |
